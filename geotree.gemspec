A GeoTree  is a variant of a k-d tree, and stores data points that have a latitude and longitude, 
a unique integer identifier, and an optional 'weight' (e.g., the size of a city).  
GeoTrees are disk-based data structures and can store a very large number of points efficiently.
If desired, for smaller data sets, memory-only trees can be constructed instead.

The gem includes MultiTree, a GeoTree variant that supports queries at 
multiple levels of detail. For example, when focusing on a 
small region it can return points that would be omitted when querying a much larger region.
